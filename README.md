# :earth_africa: GitHub contributors world map by location (WIP)
Watch in a map the contributors to a given open source project in github based on its location.

## How this work ?
I built a small API that fetch from [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) the info needed from a given user/repository and save it. Then I mark on the Map the *location* field of the first **100 contributors** to the repository selected. Yes, it's simple, it should be :)  
I will eventually made public the API used as well.

## Tips
- Click the markers on the map to watch contributors info.

### Contribute
Any contributions is welcome, better than open an issue, fix it yourself!
